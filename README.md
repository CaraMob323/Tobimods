# TobiMods

TobiMods is a "Lethal Company" mod updater and installer that aims to make all your friends have the same mods with just one click.

## Usage

For now TobiMods only reads my GitHub yml but if you understand the code you can easily change it.

- Install [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest).
- Install all the mods your friends want.
- Go to profile folder and copy mods.yml to .exe folder (this doesn't work).
- Run the .exe and select your Lethal Company folder.
- Enjoy!
